This packages allows you to easily generate trends for your models.

## Why?

Most applications require charts or reports to be generated. Doing this over again, and again can be a painfull process. That's why we've created a fluent Laravel package to solve this problem.

You can aggregate average, min, max, and totals per minute, hour, day, month and year.
